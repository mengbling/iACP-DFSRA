# iACP-DFSRA uses the following dependencies:
- python 3.7 
- numpy 1.21.6
- scikit-learn 0.24
- tensorflow 2.11
# Guiding principles:
- Folder 'data' contains train and test data used in this study.
- Folder 'model' contains scripts for training the model and testing. iACP-DFSRA-train.py was used to training the proposed model. iACP-DFSRA.h5 is the trained model.model test for testing.
- Folder 'encoding' contains the feature encoding method. protbert-bfd.py is the implementation of ProtBert_BFD. APACB.py is the implementation of five kinds of handcrafted codes APACB.
